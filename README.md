## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript

### What I learned

I've made a looped image slider for the first time, worked with responsive design, interacted with the style from JavaScript and managed the page content from SASS. I've used local storage to save user's cart, so it's saved after the page's closed.


### Continued development

The only thing that is not excactly like the page on figma is the buttons-div, that's supposed to be outside the slider div(desktop) by half of it's width.
